            <h1><b><u>INTRODUCTION</b></u></h1>
        
            <p> I was born Pamela Jean Plumlee on October 14th, <I>1958</I>.  I am a native Californian.  I worked as a Licensed Psychiatric Technician at Lanterman Developmental Center for 23 years.  Primarily with adult men with developmental disabilities and behavior issues.  I miss my clients and hope they are all flourishing in their new homes.  Due to the closure of LDC I am now retired and enjoying it very much!  I think I will probably re-enter the work force in the future but I'm not sure what I want to do.  Currently I drive an Acura Tsx (it handles corners nicely) and/or a Chevrolet Truck that is a beast.  I love animals and currently have two dogs and a cat. My bearded dragon recently died at 15 years old. Over the years as the boys grew up we've had just about every pet from snakes to guinea pigs, even a legless lizard.</p>
        
            <h2><b><u>LEARNING</u></b></h2>
            
            <P> I was trained to be a licensed psychiatric technician in 1990 and took my state boards in 1992.  For a long time all I did was work full time with alot of overtime, be a mom and play house.  In 2004 I began taking classes here at Norco, just for fun, and have been taking one or two classes spring and fall ever since.  I've also completed the classes for my adult education teaching credential.  I enjoy learning and challenging myself.  This class is a challenge for me!</P>
        
            <h3><b><u>HOBBIES</b></u></h3>
            
            <p> If it's fun, I like to do it.  Swimming, bike riding, kayaking, hiking, boating, fishing, horseback riding, gokart racing, pinball, cooking and baking, crafting, gardening and archery are probably my favorites.  I shoot a PSE compound bow; since having open shoulder surgery, I am only pulling 30 <abbr>lbs.</abbr>but getting stonger every day.  I really like shooting in tounaments.  I have a vegetable garden every year and many (I mean alot) of indoor and outdoor plants.  </p>
        
            <h4><b><u>FUTURE</u></b></h4>
            <P> While no one can predict the future, what I hope to have in mine is continued education maybe even a new career. I plan on doing some traveling but nothing to exotic right now.  I will continue to enjoy all my hobbies listed above and add a few more.  I have been working out to get back in better shape, let me tell you that once you hit 40 <abbr>yo</abbr>it is much more difficult, however it continues to be a goal for me.  I want to explore and enjoy life.</P>
